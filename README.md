# BananaModManager v0.9.0

A mod manager for Super Monkey Ball games made in Unity.

**This project is currently is still in beta and is currently not finished! It currently only supports mods that make use of code injection.**

### Currently Supported Games
- [Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061730/Super_Monkey_Ball_Banana_Blitz_HD)

(Technically, this mod manager can support many other Unity games, but this will likely change as more Super Monkey Ball specific features get added.)

### What's Missing
- Support for file redirection.
- Automatic updates for the mod manager itself.
- Automatic updates for the mods.
- GameBanana 1-click install support.

I'm currently rather busy with other projects to maintain this project on a regular basis, so I cannot guarentee when these features will arrive (if ever).

If you'd wanna help, you can create pull requests, or just reach out to me on Discord (Mors#3278).

This project is licensed under GPLv3.

## How To Install
Download the release from the [releases](https://github.com/MorsGames/BananaModManager/releases) section and extract the contents to the same folder as the game's executable.

To install the mods, create a folder called "mods" and extract the zip files there. Each mod should be in their own folder.

## How To Make Mods
Check the [BananaBlitzHDMods](https://github.com/MorsGames/BananaBlitzHDMods) repository to see some example mods.

A full guide is coming soon. Maybe. 

Or maybe not.
